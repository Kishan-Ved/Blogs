This approximation captures information about the curvature of the objective function’s landscape and guides the optimization process. BFGS has good convergence properties and doesn’t require the explicit computation of the Hessian matrix, making it suitable for problems with a large number of variables.\nL-BFGS is a variant of the BFGS algorithm that addresses the memory and computational requirements associated with the Hessian matrix. In high-dimensional optimization problems, storing and manipulating the full Hessian matrix can be expensive. L-BFGS overcomes this limitation by maintaining a limited-memory approximation of the Hessian, using only a small number of vectors.\nL-BFGS uses a recursive formula to update and approximate the inverse Hessian matrix. Instead of storing the full Hessian matrix explicitly, L-BFGS maintains a limited number of vector pairs to approximate the Hessian. This makes L-BFGS well-suited for large-scale optimization problems and enables it to operate efficiently in high-dimensional spaces.\nThe following code implements LBFGS of the function -sin(x)-cos(y)\n\nimport torch\nimport torch.optim as optim\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef f(x):\n    return -torch.sin(x[0])-torch.cos(x[1])\n\n# L-BFGS\ndef closure():\n    lbfgs.zero_grad()\n    objective = f(x_lbfgs)\n    objective.backward()\n    return objective\n\nx_lbfgs = torch.ones(2, 1)\nx_lbfgs.requires_grad = True\n\nlbfgs = optim.LBFGS([x_lbfgs],\n                    history_size=10, \n                    max_iter=4, \n                    line_search_fn=\"strong_wolfe\")\n                    \nhistory_lbfgs = []\nfor i in range(100):\n    history_lbfgs.append(f(x_lbfgs).item())\n    lbfgs.step(closure)\n\nLet us also perform gradient descent on this, with learning rate of 10^-5.\n\nx_gd = torch.ones(2, 1)\nx_gd.requires_grad = True\ngd = optim.SGD([x_gd], lr=1e-5)\n\nhistory_gd = []\nfor i in range(100):\n    gd.zero_grad()\n    objective = f(x_gd)\n    objective.backward()\n    gd.step()\n    history_gd.append(objective.item())\n\nNow, to visualize the results, we use a contour plot:\n\nx_range = np.linspace(-5, 5, 400)\ny_range = np.linspace(-5, 5, 400)\nX, Y = np.meshgrid(x_range, y_range)\n\nZ = f(torch.tensor([X, Y])).detach().numpy()\n\nfig=plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\nplt.contourf(X, Y, Z, levels=20, cmap=\"viridis\")\n\ncoordinates = np.array([2.0, 1.0])\nplt.plot(coordinates[0], coordinates[1], marker=\"o\", color=\"cyan\", label=\"Initial Coordinates\")\n\ncoordinates = x_lbfgs.detach().numpy()\nplt.plot(coordinates[0], coordinates[1], marker=\"o\", color=\"red\", label=\"LBFGS\")\n\ncoordinates = x_gd.detach().numpy()\nplt.plot(coordinates[0], coordinates[1], marker=\"o\", color=\"orange\", label=\"Grad Desc (lr=1e-5)\")\n\nplt.colorbar(label=\"Objective Value\")\nplt.xlabel(\"X\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Y\")\nplt.title(\"Contour Plot of -sin(X)-cos(Y)\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nWe observe that in a 100 iterations, the gradient descent algorithm does not converge to the minima, but remains somewhere in between. Changing the learning rate might lead to the optimal value. For L-BFGS, the convergence is at the minima.\n\n\n\nThe LBFGS method is appealing for several reasons it is very simple to implement it requires only function and gradient values and no other information on the problem # and it can be faster than the partitioned quasi Newton method on problems where the element functions depend on more than or variables\nIn addition the LBFGS method appears to be preferable to PQN for large problems in which the Hessian matrix is not very sparse or for problems in which the information on the separablity of the ob jective function is difficult to obtain."
